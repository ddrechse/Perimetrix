# Sentinel - Intelligent Geospatial Monitoring POC

This project is a Proof of Concept (POC) for an intelligent geospatial monitoring system, as described in `SentinelPOC.md` and `DemoPlan.md`.

It uses **Oracle Database 23ai** to combine traditional geospatial queries with **AI Vector Search** to reduce false-positive alerts from monitoring systems.
